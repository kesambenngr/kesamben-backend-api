I see that Docker is not installed on your system. Before you can use these configurations, you'll need to:

Install Docker Desktop for Windows from: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
After installation, restart your computer
Once Docker is running, you can use these commands to start your application:
The Docker configuration I've created will:
docker-compose build   # Build the containers
docker-compose up     # Start the containers

Run your Node.js application in a container
Run MongoDB in a separate container
Create a persistent volume for MongoDB data
Set up proper networking between the containers
Map port 3000 for your application and 27017 for MongoDB
Enable hot-reloading for development by mounting your code as a volume
Would you like me to explain any part of the configuration in more detail, or would you like help with installing Docker?
